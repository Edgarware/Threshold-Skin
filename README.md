##Installation

Copy the skin folder to ~/.steam/skins/

In Steam go to Settings > Interface > and choose Threshold from the list of skins

Restart Steam and enjoy!

##TODO
* OSX/Linux support
  * Works fine on Linux but Segoe UI renders too large. In the process of fixing font-sizes.
  * OSX support untested, likely in similar situation to Linux.
