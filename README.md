## Installation

1. Copy the skin folder to :
 - `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\skins` on 64-bits machines.
 - `C:\Program Files\Steam\skins` on 32-bits machines.

2. In Steam go to `Settings > Interface` and choose Threshold from the list of skins.

3. If customization is desired, run `customize.bat` or apply the changes manually from the `Customization` folder.

4. Restart Steam and enjoy!

## TODO

* OSX/Linux support
  * Works fine on Linux but Segoe UI renders too large. In the process of fixing font-sizes.
  * OSX support untested, likely in similar situation to Linux.
